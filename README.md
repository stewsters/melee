# Starfighter

This is a game where you pilot a small ship in a dogfight.

I did this to work on my 3d math skills, and because I like those 90's style space fighter games.

This is pretty low poly because I am not great at modeling and had limited time. I plan to add some better models in the future.


## TODO

### Game
* minimap - show where opponents are
* Turn manipulation - can turn better at lower speeds
* Ammo limitations - cannot keep shooting missiles - they are too good
* missile /ship avoidance of asteroids - probably use some flocking stuff here
* squadrons - allies that can fly in formation.  probably need to solidify factions
* capital ships (flak cannons?, long range torpedoes) 
* alternative environments
* DSL for setting up encounters


### Visual
 
* reticle for aiming?
* tracking system - show where enemies are around you
* explosions
* particles - make things seem more alive?
* actual models - make it look nicer
